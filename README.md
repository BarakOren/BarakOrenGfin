# BarakOrenG

Hello There!
My name is Barak, and I want thank you for this opportunity.

I do not know if maria told you, but this was my first interaction with Vue/Nuxt. maria asked me to bring the result on monday, and due to time pressure (I got another test to finish), I spent my time for this test learning about nuxt and sanity without any focus on BEM, tailwind or testing, and I had to pass on some important things (like adding a "loading" component).

I have finished both pages, by clicking on a player from list you can view more information about him.

inside the components you can find notes about the code.

on the list page, you can sort the players by clicking on the small arrows near each category.
I did not get the chance to figure out how to sort:
OVR - which comes as a string "Aaron Ramsey (OVR 80) - check out.."
Type - still not sure why, My first guess would be that it isnt working becuase some of the results comes with a space before the type (" Base"). 

Because this is my first time using nuxt, I am sure there are things that could be done better, I would really love and appreciate if you could send me a short feedback (barakoren5@gmail.com) 

Thank you again,
Barak oren.
